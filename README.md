# Humanitarian Risk Analytics for India: A Dual-Dataset Approach to Food Prices and Poverty

## Project Vision
To analyze and model humanitarian vulnerabilities in India by integrating market-level food price data with poverty indicators, using SQL, machine learning, and AI-powered reporting.

## Key Features
- **SQL Workflow**: Cleaned and joined market-level food price and poverty datasets
- **Python Analysis**: Exploratory trends, volatility detection, and clustering (KMeans + SHAP)
- **Power BI Dashboard**: 5 annotated pages with KPI cards, maps, outlier detection, and cluster profiles
- **Executive Reporting**: Structured PowerPoint deck with paired visual/insight slides and policy framing

## Impact
- Identifies high-risk zones for food insecurity and poverty burden
- Enables targeted policy response and scalable humanitarian monitoring
- Provides a replicable analytics framework for other regions or sectors
